# Visual_Search

## Overview
This is a project for the Artificial Inteligence laboratory.

The project provides an interactive visualization of various search algorithms, including A*, BFS, DFS, UCS, and Dijkstra's algorithm. Users can manipulate a grid to set start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize how different algorithms explore the grid and find paths.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end points, place obstacles, and reset the grid.
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Visualize the pathfinding process of multiple algorithms in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays the number of nodes from the path found by each algorithm.

## Usage
- **Setting Start and End Points**: Click on a cell to set it as the start point (orange) and another cell for the end point (turquoise).
- **Placing Obstacles**: Click on cells to place obstacles (black) to modify the grid.
- **Resetting the Grid**: Press 0 to reset the grid and clear all settings.
- **Running Algorithms**: Use the following keys to run different algorithms:
  - 1 for A* algorithm
  - 2 for BFS algorithm
  - 3 for DFS algorithm
  - 4 for UCS algorithm
  - 5 for Dijkstra's algorithm

  ## Controls
- **Left Mouse Button**: Set start/end points or place obstacles.
- **Right Mouse Button**: Reset the selected node.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
    - 0: Reset the grid.
    - 1-5: Run the corresponding algorithm.
